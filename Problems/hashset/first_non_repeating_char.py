# HT: First Non-Repeating Character ( ** Interview Question)

# You have been given a string of lowercase letters.

# Write a function called first_non_repeating_char(string) that finds the first non-repeating character in the given string
# using a hash table (dictionary). If there is no non-repeating character in the string, the function should return None.

# For example, if the input string is "leetcode", the function should return "l" because "l" is the first character that appears only once 
# in the string. Similarly, if the input string is "hello", the function should return "h" because "h" is the first non-repeating character 
# in the string.
